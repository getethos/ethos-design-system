The form below should be pre-filled with the first post returned from an initial
GET. Try updaating the values and then submit the form to generate a PUT.

```jsx noeditor
import './example.css'
;<PutExample />
```

Here's the annotated code from `PutExample` that shows how Xhr
was used for the example you see above:

```js { "file": "PutExample.js" }
```
