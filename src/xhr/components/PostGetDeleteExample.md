Click the `Get Posts` button below to trigger a GET request, then hover an item and
click its 'X' to trigger a DELETE a particular item. You can also use the
_Create a Post_ form at the bottom to trigger a POST and create a new item:

```jsx noeditor
import './example.css';
<PostGetDeleteExample />
```

This `PostGetDeleteExample` component is just an example of using _Xhr_.
Here's the annotated code from `PostGetDeleteExample` that shows how Xhr
was used for the example you see above:

```js { "file": "PostGetDeleteExample.js" }
```
