# Please do not use Media.js React component for new work!

> Until we can remove it, it is deprecated and you shouldnâ€™t use it!

Instead, we advise you to `@import` and use the `Media.scss` `mixins` e.g. `for-phone-only` from within your feature's CSS.

_We'll fully remove the React component part once we've been able to fully remove it from the codebase._
